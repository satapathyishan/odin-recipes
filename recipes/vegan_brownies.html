    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These vegan brownies are made with cocoa powder for a rich and gooey chocolaty treat. If you prefer brownies that are a little more solid, you can bake the brownies for longer than the recommended time. Great people with egg or dairy allergies, too!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: This vegan brownie starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Make sure the package is labeled “vegan,” as some store-bought white sugars aren’t strictly vegan.</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder: You’ll need ¾ cups of good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the vegan brownies rise.</li>
        <li>Salt: Salt enhances the overall flavor of the brownies, but it won’t make them taste salty.</li>
        <li>Water or coffee: Use a cup of hot water (or a cup of brewed coffee for more flavor).</li>
        <li>Oil: Vegetable oil keeps these vegan brownies nice and moist.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the dry ingredients in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients and stir until the batter is blended.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a prepared baking dish and spread evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is no longer shiny and the center feels just set.</li>
        <li>Let the brownies cool before cutting them into squares.</li>
    </ol>
