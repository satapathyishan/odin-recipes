  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
        These vegan banana muffins are moist and yummy. You can't tell at all that these muffins don't have any dairy or eggs. My kids and husband polish them off as soon as they are out of the oven!
  </p>

    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>

    <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
  </ul>
